Mapbox:

Pros:

- User flexibility/friendliness:
--- The UI is a world of difference compared to GEE. Everything seems to be intuitive and professional.

- Dataset creation flexibility:
--- There is a pipline required to display data with MapBox. First you have to convert a "dataset" to a "tile set". However, this render is EXTREMELY more efficient than GEE's.

Cons:

- Cost:
--- Cost per use policy: Independent renders of our website will have to be paid by us. Though, for development purposes, this shouldn't be too much of an issue.

- Unclear machine learning capability:
--- It seems that there isn't a place for Machine Learning in the development of visualization.
 
Google Earth Engine:

Pros:

- Extensive geographic datasets:
-- Due to its use with the general public, interestingly colored datasets are available for render.

- Python compatability:
--- Though it exists, it doesn't seem like that much of an advantage. I've only used it to create .xml files which I have to render the even-less-flexible GEE Renderer online.

Cons:

- Unclear Machine Learning capability despite Python compatability: 
--- Python seems to only be used to generate .xml. Meaning, machine learning would basically have no place, since datasets aren't "learned"

- Questionable ability to make customized datasets: 
--- Though it is indeed possible to generate datasets via python scrips which populates a .xml file, in my experience, the render is VERY slow.
--- May laptop (given, 8th gen i7 integrated graphics card) lags when a simple grid is placed on the map

- User interface:
--- It gives me a headache trying to find certain features, documentation, or methods in doing things. Everything must be in the code, nothing is provided by the GEE UI.
